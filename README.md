Data Structures & Algorithms
-------------------------------------------------------


I. Introduction:
- This repository will help demonstrate my experience so far regarding Data Structures and Algorithms, one of the many vital aspects in Computer Science. 


- Before we start, I would like to give special credits to: 
1. Algorithms book by Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne. This book is really a wonderful learning source for me. 
2. Professor George T. Heneiman, a truly wonderful, dedicated professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 
3. Edx online learning platform, one of the best self-learning sources I have found.


With that being said, let's begin! 


----------------------------------------------------------------------
II. Data Structures: 
- Here are the data structures and ADTs available in the dataStruct package: 

1. Interfaces: 
- List
- Stack
- Queue

2. Classes: 

a. Implementing List, Stack, Queues: 
- Array List
- Linked List
- Fixed Circular Queue
- Fixed Size Stack
- MultiSet

b. Binary Search Tree: 
- Binary Tree
- AVL

c. Heap: 
- Heap (abstract class)
- MaxHeap
- MinHeap

d. HashMap: 
- Chain
- ChainingHashMap

e. Graph: 
- Node
- Edge
- Graph (abstract class)
- Directed Graph
- Undirected Graph


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. Algorithms: 
- There are currently 5 sub-packages in algorithms package: 
1. SortingAlgs: 
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort (in-class version and my prior version)
- Quick Sort (in-class version and my prior version)
- Heap Sort
- Counting Sort ** 
- Radix Sort **

** These sorting algorithms only work for arrays of integers, whereas the others can work on arrays of any Comparable objects. 

2. ExpressionEvaluator: 
a. Package nodes: consists of provided stub classes for different type of mathematical operators. 
b. PEMDAS Evaluator: based on Dijkstra two-stack algorithm, I implemented a complete expression evaluator. 

3. Games (console game): 
- Tower of Hanoi. 
- Word Ladder game.
- Word Pyramid game. 

4. Recursion Practice: 
- Binary Search 
- Euclidean Alg
- Resursive Alg (including Tower Of Hanoi solver)

5. Cryptography: 
- Ceasar Cipher (encryption + decryption)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whew, that should be it for now. There are several other algorithms that I might consider including here in the future. And there are so many others out there that I have not completely explored (AI for example). Stay tuned, since the journey has just begun :)
